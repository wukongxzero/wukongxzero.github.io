I'm **Pavan Kushal Velagaleti**, a Robotics Software Developer with experience in real-time surgical robotic systems, high-speed CAN bus communication, DDS-based middleware, and motion planning.

worked as a Robotic Software Developer at **Articulus Surgical**, I build control architectures for minimally invasive surgical robotics. I specialize in **real-time IPC**, **C++/Python systems programming**, **multi-threaded communication**, and **robot GUI dashboards**.

I'm also a former **SAE BAJA team captain**, where I led the design and manufacturing of 4WD buggies and built novel suspension systems. I'm now preparing for my M.S. in Mechatronics & Robotics at **NYU Tandon**, focusing on human-machine interaction and intelligent medical robotics.

**Core Areas:**
- DDS (Cyclone, Fast DDS,Iceoryx), CAN, Embedded C, C++.
- Surgical and assistive robotics
- CFD simulation.
- ROS2(Although moveit,or gazebo is actually not very useful in low latency applications such as medical robots)
- kinematics,vehicle dynamics(ipg carmaker ..etc).
